That's a very complex and specific task. I can try to help you with generating some Arduino code for esp8266, but I cannot guarantee that it will work as intended or meet all your requirements. You may need to test and debug the code yourself or consult an expert for further assistance.

Here is my attempt to outline the strategy and assumptions for the task:

- Strategy:
  - Define constants and variables for global network packet sending frequency (GNPSF), optimal time slot (OTS), timer value (TV), wifi signal level (WSL), wifi noise level (WNL), calculated packet loss (CPL), estimated packet loss (EPL), estimated timer error (ETE), round trip time (RTT), packet arrival time (PAT), measurement noise (MN), kalman filter model (KFM), etc.
  - Initialize the esp8266 device with a random OTS and TV within the GNPSF range
  - Create a UDP socket and bind it to a port
  - Send and receive UDP broadcast packets containing data useful for the task
  - Parse the data from the packets and update the variables accordingly
  - Use gradient descent to adjust the OTS and TV based on the RTT and PAT data
  - Use kalman filter to estimate the ETE and MN based on the KFM data
  - Pulse the built-in LED at the GNPSF and report diagnostics to serial console
  - Repeat the process until convergence is reached or a timeout occurs

- Assumptions:
  - The esp8266 devices are connected to the same subnet and can communicate via UDP broadcast
  - The GNPSF is a fixed value that is known by all devices or can be negotiated dynamically
  - The OTS is a fraction of the GNPSF that indicates when each device should send its packet
  - The TV is a local counter that tracks the elapsed time since the device started or reset
  - The WSL and WNL are measured by the device's wifi module and can be obtained via API calls
  - The CPL is calculated by counting the number of packets sent and received by each device
  - The EPL is estimated by comparing the CPL with an expected value based on WSL and WNL
  - The ETE is estimated by comparing the TV with a reference value based on GNPSF and OTS
  - The RTT is measured by recording the time difference between sending and receiving a packet
  - The PAT is measured by recording the time when a packet arrives relative to the GNPSF and OTS
  - The MN is estimated by considering the variability of WSL, WNL, CPL, EPL, ETE, RTT, and PAT
  - The KFM is a mathematical representation of the system dynamics and measurement process that incorporates all the variables mentioned above
  - The gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes a cost function based on RTT and PAT data
  - The kalman filter is an estimation algorithm that updates ETE and MN based on KFM data
