That's a very challenging task. I'll try to generate some Arduino code for you, but I cannot guarantee that it will work as expected. Here are some of the assumptions and strategies that I will use:

- I will assume that the esp8266 devices are connected to the same WiFi network and have unique IP addresses.
- I will use the Arduino UDP library to send and receive broadcast packets on port 8888.
- I will use a struct to store the data that each device needs to send and receive, such as global frequency, slot number, timer value, signal level, noise level, packet loss, timer error, etc.
- I will use a global variable to store the number of nodes in the network, which can be changed at compile time. I will also use an array to store the IP addresses of the nodes.
- I will use a timer interrupt to trigger the sending and receiving of packets at regular intervals, based on the global frequency and slot number of each device.
- I will use a function to calculate the packet delay time based on the timer value and the signal level of each device.
- I will use a function to adjust the global frequency and slot number of each device based on the packet delay time and the packet loss of each device.
- I will use a Kalman filter to estimate the timer error and noise level of each device based on the data from all the packets in the network.
- I will use a function to correct the timer value of each device based on the estimated timer error and noise level.

Here is some code that implements these ideas:
