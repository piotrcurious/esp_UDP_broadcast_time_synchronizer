# esp_UDP_broadcast_time_synchronizer
synchronizes millis in the devices on the same UDP broadcast network 
By BingAI

prompt :

create Arduino code for esp8266 synchronizing millis() timer of the device with other devices in the subnet by exchanging udp broadcast packets containing data useful for the task like global network packet sending frequency, own timer value, estimates from kalman filter and convergence algorithms used, wifi signal and noise levels and calculated and estimated packet loss. use convergence strategy utilizing packet delay times and variable global packet sending frequency, so each device gets own slot in the global packet sending frequency region of the whole network to which it converges to be predictable. use kalman filter to separate noise and signal . Allow use of multiple nodes with 4 defined as compile-time default. identfy nodes by their IP. make sure to construct valid kalman filter model including orthogonality and convergence of data and noise sources, include packet loss, signal and noise level and offsets from all nodes in the kalman filter model. as it is complex task, try outlining strategy and assumptions first and then use this knowledge to write the code.

Assumptions :
This is a very complex task that requires a lot of knowledge and expertise in Arduino programming, esp8266 hardware, UDP communication, Kalman filtering, and network synchronization. I will try to outline a possible strategy and some assumptions, but I cannot guarantee that the code I generate will work as expected or be optimal. You may need to consult with a professional programmer or an online forum for more guidance and feedback.

Here is a possible strategy and some assumptions:

- Strategy:
  - Define a global network packet sending frequency (GNPSF) that is the maximum rate at which any device can send UDP broadcast packets. This should be lower than the maximum bandwidth of the esp8266 WiFi module and the network router.
  - Define a global network packet receiving frequency (GNPRF) that is the minimum rate at which any device should receive UDP broadcast packets from other devices. This should be higher than the expected packet loss rate of the network.
  - Define a global network synchronization error (GNSE) that is the maximum difference between the millis() timer values of any two devices in the network. This should be lower than the desired accuracy of the synchronization.
  - Define a global network synchronization interval (GNSI) that is the time period between two consecutive attempts to synchronize the millis() timer values of all devices in the network. This should be lower than the expected drift rate of the millis() timer due to hardware or software factors.
  - Define a global network synchronization threshold (GNST) that is the minimum number of devices that should participate in each synchronization attempt. This should be higher than half of the total number of devices in the network to ensure consensus.
  - Define a global network convergence factor (GNCF) that is a parameter that controls how fast or slow the devices adjust their GNPSF and millis() timer values based on the feedback from other devices. This should be between 0 and 1, where 0 means no adjustment and 1 means full adjustment.
  - Initialize each device with a random GNPSF value within a predefined range and a random offset value for its millis() timer within a predefined range.
  - At each GNSI, each device broadcasts a UDP packet containing its IP address, GNPSF value, millis() timer value, WiFi signal and noise levels, and packet loss estimate. It also listens for UDP packets from other devices and stores them in a buffer.
  - After receiving UDP packets from other devices, each device applies a Kalman filter to estimate the true GNPSF value and millis() timer value of each device based on its own measurements and those of other devices. It also calculates the GNSE value based on the difference between its own millis() timer value and those of other devices.
  - If the GNSE value is lower than the GNSE threshold, then the device considers itself synchronized with the network and continues to send and receive UDP packets at its current GNPSF value. It also updates its packet loss estimate based on the ratio of received packets to expected packets.
  - If the GNSE value is higher than the GNSE threshold, then the device considers itself unsynchronized with the network and tries to adjust its GNPSF value and millis() timer value based on the feedback from other devices. It does so by applying a convergence algorithm that uses the GNCF parameter to determine how much to change its GNPSF value and millis() timer value. The convergence algorithm also ensures that each device gets its own slot in the GNPSF region of the whole network by avoiding overlapping or conflicting values with other devices.
- Assumptions:
  - All devices have the same hardware and software specifications and run on the same Arduino code.
  - All devices have stable and reliable power sources and WiFi connections.
  - All devices have accurate and consistent WiFi signal and noise measurements.
  - All devices have accurate and consistent packet loss estimates.
  - All devices have accurate and consistent Kalman filter models that account for all sources of noise and error in their measurements and estimates.
  - All devices have sufficient memory and processing power to handle the UDP communication, Kalman filtering, and convergence algorithm tasks.

Here is some pseudocode that illustrates how to implement this strategy:

```c
// Define constants
#define NUM_DEVICES 4 // Number of devices in the network
#define MIN_GNPSF 10 // Minimum global network packet sending frequency (Hz)
#define MAX_GNPSF 100 // Maximum global network packet sending frequency (Hz)
#define GNPRF 50 // Global network packet receiving frequency (Hz)
#define GNSE_THRESHOLD 10 // Global network synchronization error threshold (ms)
#define GNSI 1000 // Global network synchronization interval (ms)
#define GNST 3 // Global network synchronization threshold (number of devices)
#define GNCF
