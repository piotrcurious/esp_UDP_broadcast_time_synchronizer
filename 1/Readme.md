create Arduino code for esp8266 synchronizing millis() timer of the device with other devices in the subnet by exchanging udp broadcast packets containing data useful for the task like global network packet sending frequency, own optimal time slot in global packet sending frequency, own timer value, wifi signal level, wifi noise level, calculated packet loss, estimated packet loss, estimated timer error . use convergence strategy utilizing packet delay times and variable global packet sending frequency, so each device gets own slot in the global packet sending frequency region of the whole network to which it converges to make system predictable. use kalman filter to separate noise and signal . Allow use of multiple nodes with 4 defined as compile-time default. identfy nodes by their IP. make sure to construct valid kalman filter model including orthogonality and convergence of data and noise sources, include all data from the udp packets of all nodes to create the model. as it is complex task, try outlining strategy and assumptions first and then use this knowledge to write the code.


That's a very challenging task. I'll try to generate some Arduino code for you, but I cannot guarantee that it will work as expected. Here are some of the assumptions and strategies that I will use:

- I will assume that the esp8266 devices are connected to the same WiFi network and have unique IP addresses.
- I will use the Arduino UDP library to send and receive broadcast packets on port 8888.
- I will use a struct to store the data that each device needs to send and receive, such as global frequency, slot number, timer value, signal level, noise level, packet loss, timer error, etc.
- I will use a global variable to store the number of nodes in the network, which can be changed at compile time. I will also use an array to store the IP addresses of the nodes.
- I will use a timer interrupt to trigger the sending and receiving of packets at regular intervals, based on the global frequency and slot number of each device.
- I will use a function to calculate the packet delay time based on the timer value and the signal level of each device.
- I will use a function to adjust the global frequency and slot number of each device based on the packet delay time and the packet loss of each device.
- I will use a Kalman filter to estimate the timer error and noise level of each device based on the data from all the packets in the network.
- I will use a function to correct the timer value of each device based on the estimated timer error and noise level.

Here is some code that implements these ideas:
